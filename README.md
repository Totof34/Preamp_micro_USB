It's just a box connected via USB , you don't need an external sound card to measure your speakers,

You can use REW or ARTA ( free demo version ) or an other program,

The project is based on a capsule electret, a microphone preamp, a loopback
and a second channel with a secured probe to measure the voltage across the speaker ( for ARTA )
connected via a PCM2904 from BB/TI

PCB & schema are designed with Kicad
